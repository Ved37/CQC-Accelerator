"""
CQC-Accelerator - Core CQC Engine Module

This module implements the core engine for evaluating Conjunctive Queries with Comparisons (CQCs).
It includes functionalities for preprocessing query structures, applying reduction techniques for
simplifying complex comparisons, and efficient enumeration of query results with linear-time
optimizations for acyclic queries.

Key Components:
- preprocessing.py: Optimizes query structure for efficient evaluation.
- reduction.py: Transforms long comparisons into short ones where applicable.
- enumeration.py: Implements constant-delay enumeration for query results.

This is a placeholder file to establish the directory structure. Actual implementation files will be
added as development progresses.
