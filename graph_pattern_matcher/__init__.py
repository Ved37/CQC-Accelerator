"""
CQC-Accelerator - Graph Pattern Matcher Module

This module encodes graph patterns (e.g., triangles) as Conjunctive Queries with Comparisons (CQCs)
and runs them on graph-structured data for analysis and pattern matching.

Key Components:
- pattern_encoding.py: Encodes graph patterns into CQCs.
- graph_analysis.py: Executes CQCs on graph data for pattern matching.

This is a placeholder file to establish the directory structure. Actual implementation files will be
added as development progresses.
