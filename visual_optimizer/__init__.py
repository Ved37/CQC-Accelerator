CQC-Accelerator - Visual Optimizer Module

This module provides visualization tools for Conjunctive Queries with Comparisons (CQCs). It displays
join trees and comparison graphs, highlighting distinctions between short and long comparisons to aid
in query optimization and understanding.

Key Components:
- join_trees.py: Visualizes the structure of query joins.
- comparison_graphs.py: Graphs comparisons to highlight optimization opportunities.

This is a placeholder file to establish the directory structure. Actual implementation files will be
added as development progresses.
