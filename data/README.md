# Data Directory for CQC-Accelerator

This directory is intended for storing datasets and database schemas used in the CQC-Accelerator project. It includes both real-world and synthetic datasets for testing and benchmarking Conjunctive Queries with Comparisons (CQCs).

## Subdirectories

- **datasets/**: Contains data files for query testing and analysis.
- **schemas/**: Contains database schema definitions for setting up test environments.

Note: This is a placeholder file to establish the directory structure. Actual data files and schemas will be added as the project progresses.
