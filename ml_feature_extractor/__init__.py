"""
CQC-Accelerator - ML Feature Extractor Module

This module enables the use of Conjunctive Query with Comparisons (CQC) outputs as features in
machine learning models. It integrates query results with ML pipelines for analytical workloads.

Key Components:
- feature_extraction.py: Converts query outputs into features for ML models.
- models.py: Implements integration with machine learning frameworks like Scikit-learn.

This is a placeholder file to establish the directory structure. Actual implementation files will be
added as development progresses.
